# Personal Website and Blog

This website is built using Svelte-Kit, Sanity.io and deployed on Netlify.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/1ae2ef23-2d0b-4a5a-8e7e-989003ea4ef8/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/paullj/deploys)


Svelte-Kit is the front end framework which is used to build the static website. The content is pulled from Sanity which is also used as a CMS making editing content easy. A webhook enables rebuilding and deploying whenever new content is published using the Sanity studio or if there are any changes to this git repo. 


The goal is to use this website to display and showcase my projects and thoughts while learning new technologies. The site should be fast, light, responsive and accessible. With Svelte-Kit it should be easy to make the site work without Javascript.
